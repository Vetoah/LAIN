My first ever React Native project I had made during college. The focus was student mental health (specifically time management and ways to deal with stress). At first it was mostly just page navigation, but I did give it some functionality like calendar inputs, timers, and a chatbot interface. 

To run it on the latest version of Expo Go, I had to upgrade the SDK (which resulted in this app breaking because of deprecation). Some things were tweaked to fix this, but most of the functionality has not changed much.
